Once you subscribe to the CrateDB Cloud offering, it may take up to 10 minutes for the subscription to be confirmed and usable in the CrateDB Cloud console. \n\nIf you are unable to see the deployment in your account, it may be because the subscription process is still pending or has not been completed. Additionally, to delete a cluster created via AWS Marketplace, you must unsubscribe from the offer on the AWS Marketplace website. Make sure you are logged in with the account used to subscribe to the offer, find your account name in the top right corner, and select \"Your Marketplace Software\" from the dropdown menu.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the source documentation on [AWS Marketplace deployment with CrateDB Cloud](https://cratedb.com/docs/cloud/en/latest/tutorials/deploy/marketplace/subscribe-aws.html) and [deleting a cluster via AWS Marketplace](https://cratedb.com/docs/cloud/en/latest/howtos/delete-cluster.html)."

Make sure you are using CrateDB version 5.5 or higher, as this version introduced the vector support and KNN search functionality.\n\n2. Create a new table or use an existing table where you want to add the vector type field. For example, you can create a table named `my_data` with a field `xs` of type `FLOAT_VECTOR(2)`.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE my_data (\n  xs FLOAT_VECTOR(2)\n);\n```\n\n3. Use the `ALTER TABLE` command to add a new field of type `FLOAT_VECTOR(n)` to the existing table. Replace `n` with the desired length of the vector. For example, to add a new field named `new_vector_field` of type `FLOAT_VECTOR(3)` to the `my_data` table, you can use the following command:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE my_data ADD COLUMN new_vector_field FLOAT_VECTOR(3);\n```\n\n4. Once you have added the vector type field to the table, you can insert vector data into the table. For example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO my_data VALUES ([1.6, 2.7]), ([4.6, 7.8]);\n```\n\n5. You can then perform KNN search queries on the vector data stored in the table using the `knn_match` function. For example, to find the k-nearest neighbors of a query vector `[3.14, 8]` in the `xs` field of the `my_data` table, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT xs, _score FROM my_data\nWHERE knn_match(xs, [3.14, 8], 2)\nORDER BY _score DESC;\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can alter a table in CrateDB and add a vector type field that allows for KNN search. You can find more information about vector support and KNN search in CrateDB in the [official documentation](https://cratedb.com/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-vector-support-and-knn-search-in-cratedb)."
