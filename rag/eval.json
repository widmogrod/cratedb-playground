Create a table with vector data type:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE TABLE my_data (\n     xs FLOAT_VECTOR(2)\n   );\n   ```\n\n2. Insert values into the table:\n   ```sql\n   INSERT INTO my_data VALUES ([1.6,2.7]), ([4.6, 7.8]);\n   ```\n\n3. The `FLOAT_VECTOR` type in CrateDB allows you to store dense vectors of float values of fixed length and supports KNN_MATCH for k-nearest neighbor search. This enables you to find vectors in a dataset that are similar to a query vector.\n\nYou can refer to the source for more information: [CrateDB Documentation - Data Types](https://cratedb.com/docs/crate/reference/en/master/general/ddl/data-types.html)",
