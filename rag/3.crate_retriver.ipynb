CrateDB allows users to combine vector, full-text, and keyword searches for improved semantic similarity and keyword matching, enhancing search precision and relevance. This fusion search approach enhances the search precision by combining the strengths of both vector and full-text search techniques, enabling efficient exploration and analysis of data.\n\nYou can learn more about vector similarity search and its benefits in improving accuracy and efficiency in various applications by reading this article: [Vector Similarity Search](https://cratedb.com/blog/vector-similarity-search).\n\nAdditionally, CrateDB's support for vector data types provides context aligned with your data and enhances explainability. By combining vector, full-text, and keyword searches, CrateDB enables users to perform fusion search effectively, improving the overall search experience.\n\nFor further information on open-source vector databases and their role in AI-powered applications, you can refer to this article: [Open Source Vector Database](https://cratedb.com/blog/open-source-vector-database)."

These issues can include network failures, disk failures, unexpected termination of hosts, and other unpredictable events. CrateDB has mechanisms in place to cope with these issues and maintain availability, consistency, and durability, but occasionally, things can still go wrong. It is important to be cautious of potential non-deterministic test failures, especially in a distributed environment like CrateDB. For more information on working with CrateDB and handling potential failures, you can refer to the [official documentation on resiliency](https://cratedb.com/docs/crate/reference/en/master/concepts/resiliency.html)."
