One popular option for this is PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension.\n\nHere is a general outline of how you can achieve this using PostGIS in PostgreSQL:\n\n1. First, make sure you have PostgreSQL installed with the PostGIS extension. If not, you can follow the installation instructions on the official PostGIS website: [PostGIS Installation](https://postgis.net/install/)\n\n2. Once you have PostGIS set up, you can alter your table to add a vector field by using the `ALTER TABLE` statement in SQL. Here is an example SQL query to add a vector field called `vector_field` to a table named `my_table`:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN vector_field geometry(Point, 4326);\n```\n\n3. Next, you can insert vector data into the new field using the appropriate format for your data. PostGIS supports various geometric types such as points, lines, and polygons.\n\n4. Finally, you can perform KNN searches on the vector field using the `ST_KNN` function in PostGIS. Here is an example query to find the nearest neighbors to a given point `(x, y)` in the `vector_field` column:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM my_table ORDER BY vector_field <-> 'POINT(x y)' LIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThis query will return the 10 nearest neighbors to the input point `(x, y)` based on the vector data stored in the `vector_field` column.\n\nFor more detailed information on using vector types and KNN searches in PostGIS, you can refer to the official PostGIS documentation: [PostGIS Documentation](https://postgis.net/docs/)", "output_text_b": "To alter a table and add a vector type field that allows for KNN search in CrateDB, you can follow the guidelines provided in the official CrateDB documentation on [Vector Support and KNN Search](https://cratedb.com/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-vector-support-and-knn-search-in-cratedb).
